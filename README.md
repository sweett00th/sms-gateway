# sms-gateway

Internal Unraid Docker app for receiving home server webhooks and, later, sending SMS notifications. The app runs a Deno/Hono backend, a Vite React admin panel, local SQLite persistence, local username/password auth, Docker packaging, GHCR publishing, and an Unraid template.

No Twilio sending is implemented yet.

## Architecture

- Backend: Deno + TypeScript + Hono
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript + Material UI
- Persistence: single local SQLite database
- Auth: local username/password with server-side SQLite sessions
- Live events: ephemeral in-memory Event Console streamed with Server-Sent Events
- Production: one Docker container
- Image: `ghcr.io/sweett00th/sms-gateway`
- Unraid template: `templates/sms-gateway.xml`

In production, the Deno/Hono server handles API and webhook routes and serves the built React app from `client/dist`.

In local development, the backend runs on port `3020` and Vite runs separately. Vite proxies `/api`, `/health`, and `/webhook` to `http://localhost:3020`.

SQLite uses `deno.land/x/sqlite@v3.9.1`, a WASM-based Deno SQLite module. That keeps the runtime self-contained and avoids `--allow-ffi`; the tradeoff is that this library does not support SQLite WAL mode.

## Local Development

Start the backend:

```powershell
$env:DB_PATH=".data/sms-gateway.db"
$env:ADMIN_PASSWORD="change-me"
deno task dev:server
```

Start the frontend:

```powershell
deno task dev:client
```

Run the backend, frontend, and a local mock event stream together:

```powershell
deno task dev:mock
```

Build the frontend:

```powershell
deno task build:client
```

Start the production server locally after building the frontend:

```powershell
deno task start
```

Typecheck the backend:

```powershell
deno task check
```

Format backend/Deno files:

```powershell
deno task fmt
```

Frontend typechecking is part of the client build and can also be run directly:

```powershell
npm --prefix client run typecheck
```

## Routes

- `GET /` serves the React admin panel when `client/dist` exists.
- `GET /health` returns service health and Deno runtime info.
- `GET /api/version` returns app, version, runtime, environment, and build metadata.
- `GET /api/auth/status` returns whether any local user exists.
- `GET /api/auth/me` returns the current user or `401`.
- `POST /api/auth/login` creates a server-side session and sets an HttpOnly cookie.
- `POST /api/auth/logout` deletes the current session and clears the cookie.
- `POST /api/auth/password` changes the current user's password after verifying the current password.
- `GET /api/admin/overview` returns SQLite-backed dashboard counts and provider configuration status. It requires login.
- `GET /api/events/recent` returns current in-memory Event Console events. It requires login.
- `GET /api/events/stream` streams live Event Console events with Server-Sent Events. It requires login.
- `POST /webhook/test` accepts JSON, logs a summary, emits a live test event, and returns the summary. It does not send SMS.
- `POST /webhook/jellyfin`, `/webhook/seerr`, `/webhook/radarr`, `/webhook/sonarr`, and `/webhook/sabnzbd` accept JSON and emit normalized live events. They do not send SMS.

Unknown `/api/*` and `/webhook/*` routes return JSON 404 responses. Unknown non-API routes fall back to the React `index.html` for future client-side routing.

## Webhook Secret

Webhook routes support an optional shared secret. If `SHARED_SECRET` is set, requests must include:

```text
x-sms-secret: your-secret
```

If `SHARED_SECRET` is unset, webhook requests are allowed and the server logs a startup warning. Set it in Unraid for normal use.

## Event Console

The authenticated dashboard includes a collapsible terminal-like Event Console fixed to the bottom of the viewport. It shows recent webhook events and streams new events live with Server-Sent Events from `/api/events/stream`.

Events are intentionally ephemeral and in-memory only:

- No events are written to SQLite.
- No Event Console migrations or event tables are created.
- Events are lost when the container restarts.
- The server keeps only a short runtime ring buffer.

The default ring buffer keeps events from the last `10` minutes and caps the list at `250` events. Override those with:

```env
EVENT_BUFFER_MINUTES=10
EVENT_BUFFER_MAX=250
EVENT_RAW_MAX_BYTES=20000
```

External apps still need to be configured to push webhooks into this app. This feature does not poll Jellyfin, Jellyseerr/Seerr, Radarr, Sonarr, SABnzbd, or any other app API.

The console supports source filters for Jellyfin, Seerr, Radarr, Sonarr, SABnzbd, and System/Test. Webhook payloads are normalized into compact events. Expanding an event row shows the sanitized raw webhook payload. Obvious secret-looking fields such as tokens, passwords, API keys, and authorization headers are recursively redacted. If the sanitized raw payload exceeds `EVENT_RAW_MAX_BYTES`, the expanded view shows a truncated preview with byte metadata.

For local development, the repo includes a mock webhook event generator. It posts synthetic Jellyfin, Seerr, Radarr, Sonarr, SABnzbd, and test events into the same webhook endpoints external apps use:

```powershell
deno task mock:events
```

Send one event and exit:

```powershell
deno task mock:events:once
```

The tool reads `.env`, sends `SHARED_SECRET` as `x-sms-secret` when set, and defaults to `http://localhost:$PORT`. Optional local knobs:

```env
WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3020
MOCK_EVENT_INTERVAL_MS=2500
```

## SQLite Persistence

The app stores local state in one SQLite database file. By default:

```text
/data/sms-gateway.db
```

Override it with `DB_PATH`. In Unraid, `/mnt/user/appdata/sms-gateway` is mounted to `/data`, so the database survives container updates.

Migrations run automatically on startup and are tracked in `schema_migrations`. Current tables include `users`, `sessions`, `message_receipts`, `notification_profiles`, `event_templates`, `provider_settings`, and `webhook_events`.

To reset the app in local development, stop the server and delete the SQLite file you used for `DB_PATH`, for example:

```powershell
Remove-Item .data\sms-gateway.db
```

## Local Auth

The first admin user is bootstrapped only when the `users` table is empty.

- Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` before first start.
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` defaults to `admin`.
- Passwords are stored as PBKDF2-SHA256 hashes with per-user salts.
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is ignored after any user exists.
- There is no public registration and no third-party login.

Sessions are random opaque tokens stored in an HttpOnly `sms_gateway_session` cookie. Only a SHA-256 hash of each session token is stored in SQLite. `SESSION_TTL_DAYS` controls expiry and defaults to `7`. Keep `COOKIE_SECURE=false` for local HTTP/LAN use; set it to `true` only behind HTTPS.

Authenticated users can open the profile drawer by clicking their username in the upper-right app bar. The drawer shows local account details and allows changing the password. Password changes require the current password and store a fresh PBKDF2-SHA256 hash.

## First Tests

```powershell
curl http://localhost:3020/health
```

```powershell
curl http://localhost:3020/api/version
```

```powershell
curl http://localhost:3020/api/auth/status
```

Unauthenticated admin API calls should return `401`:

```powershell
curl http://localhost:3020/api/admin/overview
```

Log in from the React UI at `http://localhost:3020/`, or use the API and keep the returned cookie in your client.

```powershell
curl -Method POST http://localhost:3020/webhook/test `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Headers @{ "x-sms-secret" = "your-secret" } `
  -Body '{"source":"manual","message":"hello from curl"}'
```

Example source webhooks:

```powershell
curl -Method POST http://localhost:3020/webhook/radarr `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Headers @{ "x-sms-secret" = "your-secret" } `
  -Body '{"eventType":"MovieDownloaded","movie":{"title":"Example Movie"},"message":"Download complete"}'
```

## Docker

Build locally:

```powershell
docker build -t sms-gateway .
```

Run locally:

```powershell
docker run --rm -p 3020:3020 `
  -e PORT=3020 `
  -e TZ=America/New_York `
  -e DB_PATH=/data/sms-gateway.db `
  -e ADMIN_USERNAME=admin `
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me `
  -e SESSION_TTL_DAYS=7 `
  -e COOKIE_SECURE=false `
  -e EVENT_BUFFER_MINUTES=10 `
  -e EVENT_BUFFER_MAX=250 `
  -v ${PWD}\.data:/data `
  sms-gateway
```

Open the admin panel:

```text
http://localhost:3020/
```

The final image runs the Deno server, not the Vite dev server. The Docker build compiles the frontend first, copies `client/dist` into the final Deno image, creates `/data`, and runs with explicit Deno permissions for env, network, `/app` reads, `/data` reads, and `/data` writes.

## GitHub Actions and GHCR

`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` builds the Docker image on pushes to `main`, pull requests, and semver tags like `v0.1.0`.

Pull requests build but do not push images. Pushes to `main` and tags publish to:

```text
ghcr.io/sweett00th/sms-gateway
```

Expected tags include:

- `latest` for the default branch
- `v0.1.0` style semver tags
- `sha-<commit>` for commit builds

## Unraid

The Unraid template points to:

```text
ghcr.io/sweett00th/sms-gateway:latest
```

The WebUI opens the admin panel at:

```text
http://[IP]:[PORT:3020]/
```

To add the custom template repository in Unraid, use:

```text
https://github.com/sweett00th/sms-gateway
```

Keep the app LAN-only. This scaffold does not assume public proxying, Cloudflare, NPM, or any external ingress.

Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` before the first start so the app can create the initial local admin user. After that, changing `ADMIN_USERNAME` or `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the template will not overwrite existing users.
