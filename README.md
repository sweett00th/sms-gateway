# ObservaRR

Internal Unraid Docker app for receiving home server webhooks, managing future notification recipient profiles, and later sending notifications. The app runs a Deno/Hono backend, a Vite React admin panel, local SQLite persistence, local username/password auth, Docker packaging, GHCR publishing, and an Unraid template.

SMS delivery is implemented through Textbelt and is disabled by default. Email templates are stored for future use, but email delivery is not implemented.

## Architecture

- Backend: Deno + TypeScript + Hono
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript + Material UI
- Persistence: single local SQLite database
- Auth: local username/password with server-side SQLite sessions
- Live events: ephemeral in-memory Event Console streamed with Server-Sent Events
- Media timelines: identified media events persisted for audit and gap analysis
- Notification profiles: local recipient profiles with contacts, SMS consent, external mappings, preferences, and Jellyfin avatar imports
- Event templates: global SMS/email templates per source/event with safe `{variableName}` rendering
- SMS receipts: durable Textbelt submission and delivery-status receipts
- Production: one Docker container
- Image: `ghcr.io/sweett00th/observarr`
- Unraid template: `templates/observarr.xml`

In production, the Deno/Hono server handles API and webhook routes and serves the built React app from `client/dist`.

In local development, the backend runs on port `3020` and Vite runs separately. Vite proxies `/api`, `/health`, and `/webhook` to `http://localhost:3020`.

SQLite uses `deno.land/x/sqlite@v3.9.1`, a WASM-based Deno SQLite module. That keeps the runtime self-contained and avoids `--allow-ffi`; the tradeoff is that this library does not support SQLite WAL mode.

## Local Development

Start the backend:

```powershell
$env:DB_PATH=".data/observarr.db"
$env:ADMIN_PASSWORD="change-me"
deno task dev:server
```

Start the frontend:

```powershell
deno task dev:client
```

Run the backend, frontend, and a local mock event stream together:

```powershell
deno task dev:mock
```

Build the frontend:

```powershell
deno task build:client
```

Start the production server locally after building the frontend:

```powershell
deno task start
```

Typecheck the backend:

```powershell
deno task check
```

Format backend/Deno files:

```powershell
deno task fmt
```

Frontend typechecking is part of the client build and can also be run directly:

```powershell
npm --prefix client run typecheck
```

Unknown `/api/*` and `/webhook/*` routes return JSON 404 responses. Unknown non-API routes fall back to the React `index.html` for future client-side routing.

## Webhook Secret

Webhook routes support an optional shared secret. If `SHARED_SECRET` is set, requests must include:

```text
x-sms-secret: your-secret
```

If `SHARED_SECRET` is unset, webhook requests are allowed and the server logs a startup warning. Set it in Unraid for normal use.

## Event Console

The authenticated app includes a collapsible terminal-like Event Console fixed to the bottom of the viewport. It shows recent webhook events and streams new events live with Server-Sent Events from `/api/events/stream`.

The Event Console buffer is intentionally ephemeral and in-memory only:

- Events are lost when the container restarts.
- The server keeps only a short runtime ring buffer.

Separately, every identifiable media webhook event is persisted to Media Timelines. If an event can be associated to a movie or series, the app creates or updates that media item and appends the event to its timeline.

The default ring buffer keeps events from the last `10` minutes and caps the list at `250` events. Override those with:

```env
EVENT_BUFFER_MINUTES=10
EVENT_BUFFER_MAX=250
EVENT_RAW_MAX_BYTES=20000
```

External apps still need to be configured to push webhooks into this app. This feature does not poll Jellyfin, Jellyseerr/Seerr, Radarr, Sonarr, SABnzbd, or any other app API.

The console supports source filters for Jellyfin, Seerr, Radarr, Sonarr, SABnzbd, and System/Test. Webhook payloads are normalized into compact events. Expanding an event row shows the sanitized raw webhook payload. Obvious secret-looking fields such as tokens, passwords, API keys, and authorization headers are recursively redacted. If the sanitized raw payload exceeds `EVENT_RAW_MAX_BYTES`, the expanded view shows a truncated preview with byte metadata.

## Media Timelines

The dashboard includes a `Media Timelines` widget. Open it to see media items identified from webhook events. The page has a searchable media list, a scrollable sorted event list for the selected item, and a horizontal timeline graph with source-colored dots. Hover over a dot to see event details and the gap from the previous step.

Media timeline rows can be selected individually or in bulk from the left column and deleted manually. Deleting a media item removes its associated timeline events through SQLite cascade cleanup.

Timeline persistence is automatic:

1. A webhook event arrives.
2. The server normalizes the event.
3. The server identifies the distinct piece of media using strong IDs, structured fields, or loose normalized title matching.
4. If the media has been seen before, the event is appended to that media timeline.
5. If the media is new, a timeline is created and the event is appended.

Media matching is intentionally loose in this pass. The app first tries derived keys from common fields such as `movie.title`, `series.title`, `tmdbId`, `imdbId`, `tvdbId`, `title`, `subject`, and media type hints. If that misses, incoming events are compared against existing media titles using normalized text from the event title, message, entity title, and sanitized raw payload. Source-specific matching can be improved later as real payload samples arrive.

Media Timelines also stores a thumbnail URL when webhook payloads provide one through common poster/image fields such as `posterUrl`, `thumbnailUrl`, `imageUrl`, `movie.remotePoster`, `series.remotePoster`, or image arrays from media managers. If no thumbnail is available, the UI shows an initial-based fallback.

When an event type normalizes to `MEDIA_AVAILABLE`, the media item is marked available and scheduled for cleanup after 14 days. Cleanup runs once on startup and then once per day while the container is running.

For local development, the repo includes a mock webhook event generator. It posts synthetic Jellyfin, Seerr, Radarr, Sonarr, SABnzbd, and test events into the same webhook endpoints external apps use:

```powershell
deno task mock:events
```

Send one event and exit:

```powershell
deno task mock:events:once
```

The tool emits realistic multi-step media journeys. A movie flow looks like Seerr request, Seerr approval, Radarr grab, SABnzbd download, Radarr import, Seerr available, Jellyfin library update, and Jellyfin playback. Series flows use Sonarr in the equivalent steps. Events in one journey share media IDs/titles so Media Timelines can reconstruct end-to-end behavior.

The tool reads `.env`, sends `SHARED_SECRET` as `x-sms-secret` when set, and defaults to `http://localhost:$PORT`. Optional local knobs:

```env
WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3020
MOCK_EVENT_INTERVAL_MS=2500
```

## Notification Profiles

The authenticated dashboard includes a Notification Profiles management dialog. These profiles represent future notification recipients and are separate from local ObservaRR admin login users.

Profiles store:

- Display name and enabled/disabled state
- Optional phone number and email address
- Explicit SMS opt-in/out timestamps
- Optional Jellyfin and Seerr identity mappings
- Imported Jellyfin avatar metadata
- Event-specific interest, future SMS preference, and future email preference

Saving profile preferences does not send messages by itself. Imported Jellyfin users are not automatically subscribed to any notification event, delivery channel, or SMS consent.

The stable template/event catalog is served by the backend at `/api/event-templates/catalog` so the API and UI use the same source, event type, variable, and default-template values.

## Event Templates and SMS Delivery

Event templates are global per `(source, event_type)`. A profile preference decides whether that recipient is interested in the event and wants SMS or email, but it does not own a private copy of the template. Editing a template from a profile event row changes it for every profile subscribed to that event.

Template syntax is deliberately small:

```text
{variableName}
```

Use `{{` for a literal `{` and `}}` for a literal `}`. Only variables listed by `/api/event-templates/catalog` are allowed. Unknown variables and malformed braces block saving. Templates cannot execute JavaScript, expressions, loops, conditionals, dot paths, or arbitrary payload access.

SMS templates and email subject/body templates are stored and previewed. Email transport is not configured yet, so ObservaRR does not send email and does not create fake email receipts.

Textbelt is the only SMS provider. Real SMS requires all of these:

- `NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true`
- `TEXTBELT_KEY` configured server-side
- an enabled notification profile
- an enabled profile phone number
- explicit phone-number SMS opt-in recorded in ObservaRR
- profile event preference enabled with SMS selected
- a valid global SMS template for that source/event

Imported Jellyfin profiles are not automatically opted into SMS. `/webhook/test` and Event Console test events never send SMS.

## Message Receipts

Every attempted outbound SMS creates a durable receipt before provider submission. Receipts preserve the rendered message body, template revision, masked destination, safe render context, provider message ID, provider response metadata, quota remaining, and separate submission/delivery statuses.

Submission status tracks whether ObservaRR submitted the request to Textbelt:

```text
pending, submitted, rejected, failed, submission_unknown, render_failed, skipped
```

Delivery status tracks later provider delivery state:

```text
not_applicable, unknown, sending, sent, delivered, failed
```

`submitted` or `sent` does not guarantee handset delivery. A background in-process poller checks recent Textbelt message IDs every 10 minutes and updates delivery status when Textbelt reports progress.

Receipts never store the Textbelt API key, raw webhook payloads, unmasked phone numbers, email addresses, authorization headers, or provider request bodies. Receipts are linked to the profile phone-number row that was used for dispatch when available.

### Textbelt reply webhooks and SMS opt-in

ObservaRR exposes `POST /webhook/textbelt/reply` for Textbelt SMS replies. Textbelt sends reply JSON with `fromNumber` and `text`; ObservaRR matches the sender to a profile phone number, stores the reply text, and marks the number opted in when the response contains consent language such as `Y`, `Yes`, `OK`, `okay`, `confirmed`, `agree`, `start`, or `subscribe`. Stop/unsubscribe style replies mark the number opted out.

Opt-in welcome texts are never sent automatically. An admin must explicitly send the opt-in text for one phone number or all unsent phone numbers on a profile. `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` must be reachable by Textbelt for reply handling; ObservaRR passes `${WEBHOOK_BASE_URL}/webhook/textbelt/reply` as Textbelt's `replyWebhookUrl` on opt-in welcome messages.

Profiles can store multiple phone numbers. Each number has its own enabled flag, opt-in lifecycle, last reply, and linked receipts. Imported profiles remain unsubscribed until an admin adds a phone number and sends an opt-in welcome text.

### Media interests

Profiles now have a normalized media-interest table for future subscription management. The default is zero movie or series interests, so media notifications are gated until an enabled profile media interest matches the event's identified media. ObservaRR uses TMDB IDs when available, including Seerr `media.tmdbId`, Radarr/Sonarr payload IDs, and Jellyfin `Provider_tmdb`. Jellyfin `SeriesId` is retained so orphan Season `ItemAdded` events can later be associated with the Series `ItemAdded` event that contains TMDB metadata. SABnzbd events fall back to title/year matching through the existing media timeline identity logic.
## Jellyfin Profile Import

Jellyfin import is optional and requires these server-only environment variables:

```env
JELLYFIN_URL=
JELLYFIN_API_KEY=
```

`JELLYFIN_URL` should be the internal Jellyfin base URL reachable from the ObservaRR container, such as `http://192.168.1.50:8096`. `JELLYFIN_API_KEY` is secret, is never returned to the browser, and should be masked in Unraid.

Importing Jellyfin users:

1. Fetches Jellyfin users from the server side.
2. Uses Jellyfin user ID as the stable external identity key.
3. Creates or updates local notification profiles idempotently.
4. Refreshes Jellyfin username and identity sync metadata.
5. Caches primary avatars under `/data/avatars` when available.
6. Preserves local phone number, email address, enabled state, Seerr mapping, and all event preferences on repeat import.

Avatar files are not exposed as an unrestricted static directory. The browser loads them only through the authenticated `/api/notification-profiles/:id/avatar` endpoint.
## SQLite Persistence

The app stores local state in one SQLite database file. By default:

```text
/data/observarr.db
```

Override it with `DB_PATH`. In Unraid, `/mnt/user/appdata/observarr` is mounted to `/data`, so the database survives container updates.

Migrations run automatically on startup and are tracked in `schema_migrations`. Current tables include `users`, `sessions`, `message_receipts`, `notification_profiles`, `profile_external_identities`, `profile_event_preferences`, `event_templates`, `provider_settings`, `webhook_events`, `media_items`, and `media_events`. Legacy placeholder tables `event_templates_legacy` and `message_receipts_legacy` may exist on upgraded databases. Older development tables `tracked_media` and `tracked_media_events` may also exist on upgraded local databases.

To reset the app in local development, stop the server and delete the SQLite file you used for `DB_PATH`. To also remove imported avatar cache, delete the avatar directory. This removes local ObservaRR data, users, profiles, mappings, preferences, and media timelines.

```powershell
Remove-Item .data\observarr.db
Remove-Item -Recurse .data\avatars
```

## Local Auth

The first admin user is bootstrapped only when the `users` table is empty.

- Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` before first start.
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` defaults to `admin`.
- Passwords are stored as PBKDF2-SHA256 hashes with per-user salts.
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is ignored after any user exists.
- There is no public registration and no third-party login.

Sessions are random opaque tokens stored in an HttpOnly `observarr_session` cookie. Only a SHA-256 hash of each session token is stored in SQLite. `SESSION_TTL_DAYS` controls expiry and defaults to `7`. Keep `COOKIE_SECURE=false` for local HTTP/LAN use; set it to `true` only behind HTTPS.

Authenticated users can open the profile drawer by clicking their username in the upper-right app bar. The drawer shows local account details and allows changing the password. Password changes require the current password and store a fresh PBKDF2-SHA256 hash.

## First Tests

```powershell
curl http://localhost:3020/health
```

```powershell
curl http://localhost:3020/api/version
```

```powershell
curl http://localhost:3020/api/auth/status
```

Unauthenticated admin API calls should return `401`:

```powershell
curl http://localhost:3020/api/admin/overview
```

Log in from the React UI at `http://localhost:3020/`, or use the API and keep the returned cookie in your client.

```powershell
curl -Method POST http://localhost:3020/webhook/test `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Headers @{ "x-sms-secret" = "your-secret" } `
  -Body '{"source":"manual","message":"hello from curl"}'
```

Example source webhooks:

```powershell
curl -Method POST http://localhost:3020/webhook/radarr `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Headers @{ "x-sms-secret" = "your-secret" } `
  -Body '{"eventType":"MovieDownloaded","movie":{"title":"Example Movie"},"message":"Download complete"}'
```

## Docker

Build locally:

```powershell
docker build -t observarr .
```

Run locally:

```powershell
docker run --rm -p 3020:3020 `
  -e PORT=3020 `
  -e TZ=America/New_York `
  -e DB_PATH=/data/observarr.db `
  -e ADMIN_USERNAME=admin `
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me `
  -e SESSION_TTL_DAYS=7 `
  -e COOKIE_SECURE=false `
  -e EVENT_BUFFER_MINUTES=10 `
  -e EVENT_BUFFER_MAX=250 `
  -e NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false `
  -e TEXTBELT_KEY=replace-with-unraid-secret `
  -e TEXTBELT_SENDER=ObservaRR `
  -e JELLYFIN_URL=http://jellyfin.local:8096 `
  -e JELLYFIN_API_KEY=replace-with-unraid-secret `
  -v ${PWD}\.data:/data `
  observarr
```

Open the admin panel:

```text
http://localhost:3020/
```

The final image runs the Deno server, not the Vite dev server. The Docker build compiles the frontend first, copies `client/dist` into the final Deno image, creates `/data/avatars`, and runs with explicit Deno permissions for env, network, `/app` reads, `/data` reads, and `/data` writes.

## GitHub Actions and GHCR

`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` builds the Docker image on pushes to `main`, pull requests, and semver tags like `v0.1.0`.

Pull requests build but do not push images. Pushes to `main` and tags publish to:

```text
ghcr.io/sweett00th/observarr
```

Expected tags include:

- `latest` for the default branch
- `v0.1.0` style semver tags
- `sha-<commit>` for commit builds

## Unraid

The Unraid template points to:

```text
ghcr.io/sweett00th/observarr:latest
```

The WebUI opens the admin panel at:

```text
http://[IP]:[PORT:3020]/
```

To add the custom template repository in Unraid, use:

```text
https://github.com/sweett00th/observarr
```

Keep the app LAN-only. This scaffold does not assume public proxying, Cloudflare, NPM, or any external ingress.

Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` before the first start so the app can create the initial local admin user. After that, changing `ADMIN_USERNAME` or `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the template will not overwrite existing users.
